# Ansible

My collection of Ansible roles, playbooks, & inventories (inventory files are examples, meant to be copied & built from).

## Requirements

!!! note 

    This project was build with [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/). If you prefer another tool like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), make sure to convert the [`pyproject.toml` file](#) to a Poetry-compatible format.

- (Optional) [`pdm` Python project manager](https://pdm-project.org/)
  - You can also `pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt`
